# 📐 Add Comments to Mongoose CRUD Operations

Work with a partner to add comments that describe the functionality of the CRUD operations found in [Unsolved/controllers/appController.js](./Unsolved/controllers/appController.js).

## 📝 Notes

* Be sure to run `npm install`, `npm run seed`, and `npm start`.

* Refer to the documentation: [Mongoose docs on constructing models](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/models.html)

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What is the difference between `findOneAndDelete()` and `findOne()` + `remove()`? Or similarly, what is the difference between `findOneAndUpdate()` and `findOne()` + `save()`?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
