# 🐛 Tag Population Not Working

Work with a partner to resolve the following issue:

- As a user, I should be able to see all tags associated with a `post` after running the Mongoose populate method on the `Posts` model.

## Expected Behavior

When a user queries a `post`, the controller should return the `post` with an array that is populated with the associated `tags`.

## Actual Behavior

When a user runs the application in an attempt to get a post, they are presented with the following error:

```sh
TypeError: Invalid schema configuration: `Tag` is not a valid type within the array `tags`
```

## Steps to Reproduce the Problem

Follow these steps to reproduce the problem:

1. In the command line, navigate to `Unsolved/` and run `npm i`.

2. Run `npm run seed` to populate an example database, or `npm run dev` to run the development server.

3. Notice the following error: `` TypeError: Invalid schema configuration: `Tag` is not a valid type within the array `tags ``.

## 💡 Hints

- When referencing another schema inside a Post schema, what attributes and types must be specified?

- Use `npm run dev` to automatically restart your application after you save changes.

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

- What are the performance benefits associated with using the populate method in Mongoose as opposed to the `$lookup` operator in MongoDB?
