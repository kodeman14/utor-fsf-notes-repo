# 🏗️ Implement Instance Methods on a Mongoose Model

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to perform an action on a specific instance of a Mongoose model.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It is done when I define a new schema named `bookSchema`.

* It is done when the new schema has three properties: `title`, `author`, and `price`.

* It is done when I assign a function named `getDiscount` to the methods object of the `bookSchema` that reduces the price by 50 percent and console logs the title of the book and the reduced price.

* It is done when I have created a model named `Book`.

* It is done when I have created an instance of the model, or document, named `discountedBook`.

* It is done when I test the instance method by running `node models/Book.js`.

* It is done when the price of `discountedBook` is reduced by 50 percent and the results are logged to the console.

## 💡 Hints

What is the difference between an instance method and a static method?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* How can you add query helper methods to extend Mongoose's chainable query builder API?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
