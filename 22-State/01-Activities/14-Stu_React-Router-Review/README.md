# 🏗️ Implement Single-Thought Page Display

Work with a partner to implement the following user stories:

* As a user, I want to view individual thoughts and a list of comments.

* As a user, I want to be able to bookmark a thought's page so I can return and read more comments.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when, once I select a thought on the homepage, I am taken to that thought's page to view its comments without reloading the page.

* It's done when, once I visit the thought directly in the browser, I am taken to that thought's page to view its comments.

## Assets

The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality:

## 💡 Hints

How can the value of the `to` prop in each thought's `<Link>` component help us define the route?

How can we define a route with a parameter using React Router?

How can we use the `useParams()` Hook to retrieve data for use in the `useQuery()` Hook?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* Which browser API does React Router leverage?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
