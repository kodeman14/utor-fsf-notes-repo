## 💡 Hints

How do we make sure that the database is seeded?

Which `npm` package allows us to run both the front end and the back end at the same time? How do you start it?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* Why do we create variable names for each action type in `actions.js`?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
