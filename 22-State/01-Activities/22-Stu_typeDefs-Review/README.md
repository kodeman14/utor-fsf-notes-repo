# 🏗️ Implement Type Definitions for GraphQL

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to define a set of type definitions to validate my return data when using GraphQL.

## Before You Begin

1. Navigate to the `22-Stu_TypeDefs/Unsolved` directory in the terminal.

2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

3. Run `npm run seed` to seed your MongoDB database for this activity.

4. Run `npm run develop` to start both the front end and back end servers.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I have created a `typeDefs.js` file in `/server/schemas`.

* It's done when I have created a `typeDefs` template that contains types for `Category`, `Product`, `Order` and `User`.

## 💡 Hints

How can we use the models defined in the `/models` directory to inform us of the kind of data that we can expect?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What is an `enum`, and how can it be used in type definitions?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
