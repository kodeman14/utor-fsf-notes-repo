# 📐 Add Comments to Implementation of useReducer

Work with a partner to add comments describing the functionality of the code found in [StudentList](Unsolved/src/components/StudentList.js).

## 📝 Notes

When is local state being used as opposed to global state in this application?

What do we need to pass to the `dispatch()` function to add a new major?

Refer to the documentation:

[React documentation on useReducer hook](https://react.dev/reference/react/useReducer)

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* How does React know what to update if the state has changed?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
