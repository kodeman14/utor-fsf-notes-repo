# 🐛 curl Command to GitHub API Doesn't Work

Work with a partner to resolve the following issue(s):

* As a developer, I want to use `curl` to verify a connection to the GitHub API.

## Expected Behavior

When the command `curl http://api.github.com` is run from the command line, the output includes the following data:

```json

  "user_search_url": "https://api.github.com/search/users?q={query}{&page,per_page,sort,order}"
