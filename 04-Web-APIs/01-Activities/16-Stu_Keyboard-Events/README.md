# 📖 Implement Keyboard Events to Display Value and Code of Pressed Key

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to display the value and code of a pressed key.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when, if a key is pressed down, the value of the key and the key's code is displayed. `KEYDOWN Event` should also be displayed to indicate the type of event. 

* It's done when, if the key is released, `KEYUP Event` is displayed.

## 📝 Notes

## 💡 Hints

What properties can we use to access the value of the pressed key and the key's code?
