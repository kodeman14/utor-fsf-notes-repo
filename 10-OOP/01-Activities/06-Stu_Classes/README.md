# 🏗️ Create Objects Using a Class Constructor

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to create new objects using a Class Constructor.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when a class constructor is created named `BlogPost()` and it takes in five parameters, `authorName`, `title`, `text`, `comments` (this should be an empty array with no argument passed), `createdOn` (this should be a date).

* It's done when the parameters are passed into the object's keys as their values.

* It's done when the object's fifth key is a method called `printMetaData()` that prints a message in the console saying `Created by (authorName) on (createdOn)`.

* It's done when the object's sixth key is a method called `addComment()` that takes in a comment and adds it to the `comments` array on the BlogPost.

* It's done when I create a new object using the `BlogPost()` class constructor with my own custom values.

* It's done when a class constructor is created named `Comment()` and it takes in three parameters, `authorName`, `text`, and `createdOn`.

* It's done when the object's fourth key is a method called `printMetaData()` that prints a message in the console saying `Created by (authorName) on (createdOn) with (text)`

* It's done when I create a new object using the `Comment()` class constructor with my own custom values.

* It's done when I add the newly created Comment to the BlogPost using the `addComment()` method.

* It's done when the meta data for both the BlogPost and the Comment are printed to the console.

## 💡 Hints

What method needs to be written inside the Class to initialize its properties?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* "Encapsulation" is one of the four pillars of OOP. Explain the benefits of encapsulation. What is meant by the "state" of an object?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
