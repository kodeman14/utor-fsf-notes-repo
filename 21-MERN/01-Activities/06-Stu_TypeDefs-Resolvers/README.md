# 🏗️ Update Professors to Include Their Classes

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to be able to query for professors and their classes at the same time.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when a query in the Apollo Sandbox is able to return data similar to the following:

  ```json
  "professors": [
    {
      "name": "Rebecca Watts",
      "classes": [
        {
          "name": "Introduction to Computational Thinking"
        },
        {
          "name": "User Interface Design"
        },
        {
          "name": "Internet Architecture and Protocols"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
  ```
