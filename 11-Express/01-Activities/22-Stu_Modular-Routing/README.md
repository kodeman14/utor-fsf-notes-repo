# 📖 Implement Modular Routes

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to modularize my route logic from the rest of my server so that I can separate concerns appropriately.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the routes in `server.js` are broken into modules based on different endpoints.

* It's done when I have moved my tips routes to a `tips.js` file that uses express.Router.

* It's done when I have an `index.js` file that imports all my router files.

* It's done when I have required my `index.js` file inside my `server.js` file.

## 📝 Notes

Refer to the documentation:

[Express.js documentation on express.Router](http://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html#express-router)

## 💡 Hints

When we modularize our routes, which dependencies will we need to import at the top of our new files?

How does the separation of concerns help other developers who might work with your code in the future?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What are some best practices for naming your routes?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
