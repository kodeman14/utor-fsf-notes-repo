# 🏗️ Write Function to Evaluate Equality of Two Values

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to know when two values are equal to one another.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I provide two values in function arguments and the function evaluates the values' equality. 

* It's done if, when the values are strictly equal, the message "They are equal in type and value" is logged. 

* It's done if, when the two values are equal but not strictly equal, the message "They are equal in value" is logged.

* It's done if, when the values are not equal or strictly equal, the message "They are not equal" is logged.

* It's done if, when the `isEqual` function is rewritten as a function expression and when called with values that are not equal or strictly equal, the message "They are not equal" is logged.

## 💡 Hints

How can we use parameters to give a name to the two values that we want to evaluate with the function?  

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What is hoisting?
