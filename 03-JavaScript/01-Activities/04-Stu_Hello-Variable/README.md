# 🏗️ Log Introduction Messages to Console Using Values Stored in Variables 

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a class member, I want to input data about my name, the number of pets I own, and a fun fact about myself and log that introduction to the console. Then I want to log a message to introduce my partner by reassigning the variables.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I store a name in a variable called `personName` and this line is logged to the console: "My name is `VALUE_STORED_IN_VARIABLE_NAME`."

* It's done when I store a number in a variable called `pets` and this line is logged to the console: "I have `VALUE_STORED_IN_VARIABLE_PETS` pet(s)."

* It's done when I store a fun fact in a variable called `funFact` and this line is logged to the console: "Fun fact: `VALUE_STORED_IN_VARIABLE_FUNFACT`."

* It's done when I reassign the values of `personName`, `pets`, and `funFact` with my new partner's information and the logs in the console reflect the new values.

## 💡 Hints

How can we combine values using the concatenation operator (`+`) to log a single message to the console?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What happens when you concatenate two variables in a single console log using `+`? Is the result what you expected? Why or why not?
