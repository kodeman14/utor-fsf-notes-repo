# 🏗 Log Welcome Messages to Console Using an Array

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As an instructor, I want to create a list of student names and be able to add and rename names.

## Acceptance Criteria 

* It's done when the total number of elements in the array is logged to the console.  

* It's done when the message "Welcome to the class STUDENT_NAME" is logged using each element in the array. 

* It's done when the first element in the array is replaced with the name of a new student.

* It's done when, after an `if` statement confirms that the first element in the array has been replaced, the message "REPLACED_NAME is in class" is logged.

## 💡 Hints

What is the first index in an array: `0` or `1`? 

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* How could you use the array's `length` property to access the last element in an array of any length?
