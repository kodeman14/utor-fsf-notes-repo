# 🏗️ Log Customer's Drink Order Using an Object

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a coffee shop owner, I want to store data about my customer's drink order in an object and log a message indicating whether the drink is ready or still in the queue. 

## Acceptance Criteria 

* It's done when the `customerDrink` object has three properties that store the drink's name, the number of sugars, and a Boolean indicating whether the order is ready. 

* It's done when the drink name and the number of sugars is logged to the console. 

* It's done when, if the order is ready, the message `"Ready for pick-up"` logs. 

* It's done when, if the order is not ready, the message `"Still in order queue"` logs. 

## 💡 Hints

How can we use dot notation or bracket notation to access an object's values? 

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What is a `for...in` statement? How can you use it to iterate over an object’s properties?
