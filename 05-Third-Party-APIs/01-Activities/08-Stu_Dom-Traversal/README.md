## 💡 Hint

## 🏆 Bonus 

If you have completed the activity and want to further your knowledge, work through the following challenge with your partner:

* What are some alternative methods to traverse up and down the DOM tree? Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to answer this question.
