## 💡 Hints

* There is a color theme already available to use in `style.css`, but feel free to use [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/).

* Don't forget to use the previous example as a guide to how custom styles can be applied with CSS.

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed the activity and want to further your knowledge, work through the following challenge with your partner: 

* What are some other UI frameworks that we could use? To get started, try [Bulma](https://bulma.io/), [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/), and a very customizable one called [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/).
