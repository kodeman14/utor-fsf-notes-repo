## 💡Hints

* When in doubt, use the Bootstrap documentation links in the comments and Chrome DevTools to break down the classes and styles used!

* Look down the left-hand side of the Bootstrap documentation to see the different types of components.

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed the activity and want to further your knowledge, work through the following challenge with your partner:
