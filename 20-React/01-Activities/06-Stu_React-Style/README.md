# 📖 Implement React Styling

## Activity

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to know how to style a React component using built-in options.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I have added inline styles to the `Header`, `Navbar`, and `Section` components.

* It's done when I have updated each component so that the rendered page looks like the [inline styled example](./Images/02-InlineStyled.png) using only inline styles, and without altering any of the CSS files.

## 📝 Notes

Refer to the documentation:

* [React Docs on style](https://react.dev/learn#adding-styles)

* [React Enlightenment guide to additional styling](https://www.reactenlightenment.com/react-jsx/5.6.html)
