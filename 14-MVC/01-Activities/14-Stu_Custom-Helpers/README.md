# 🐛 Date Is Not Formatted Correctly

Work with a partner to resolve the following issues:

* Museum visitors should be able to see the end date of each painting on the painting page.

## Expected Behavior

* When a museum visitor visits the painting page, it should clearly and accurately show the date that the exhibition will end.

* The end date is calculated by adding five years to the painting's `exhibition_date`.

* The end date should be formatted as `M/D/YYYY`.

## Actual Behavior

When a museum visitor visits the exhibition page, it shows the painting's `exhibition_date` in the original long timestamp format.

## Assets

The following image demonstrates the correct formatting of the end date for each painting:
